Last Thursday, almost all of RESIDE went to [RSLondonSE](https://rslondon.ac.uk/rslondonse-2020/), a small and friendly one-day meeting of RSEs.

We presented two posters - in one we outline the basic idea behind three common JavaScript frameworks (Angular, React and Vue.js) and reasons for choosing one over another.  We will rework this poster as a more detailed blog post or article and also as a standalone seminar later this year.

In the [other poster](/resources/RSLondonSE-hint-poster.pdf), we present the ideas behind our [Naomi](/projects/naomi) project, where we developed a pattern for exposing research software "as a service" using HTTP APIs and a modern web front end (written in Vue.js amongst other things).  We think this is a general pattern, though most of the software for Naomi is bespoke.

There were lots of other great talks, with this year much more Python than Fortran, and more Machine Learning than HPC.  A hightlight was multiple people discussing the ethical side of machine learning and approaches for securely working with sensitive data.
