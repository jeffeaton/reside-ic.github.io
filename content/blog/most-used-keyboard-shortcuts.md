title: My favourite keyboard shortcuts
---

Anyone who uses a computer for a significant amount of time each day should 
spend some time learning keyboard shortcuts - they can save you so much time! 

When I started working as a developer, I learnt keyboard shortcuts through pair programming, 
asking more experienced programmers what their favourite shortcuts were, and even just reading
documentation for the IDEs I was using 
([VisualStudio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/default-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) 
with [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Reference__Keyboard_Shortcuts.html) at the time,
 now [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html).) 

### OS
These shortcuts are absolute essentials. If you don't already use them, spend 
some time memorising and practising them. It'll save you loads of time in the long run.

* `ctr-a` - select all
* `ctrl-c` - copy
* `ctr-x` - cut
* `ctrl-v` - paste

I'm on Linux, but these shortcuts work on Mac and Windows too (on Mac `ctrl` is replaced by `cmd`)

* `alt-tab` - toggle between open apps
    * plus use the arrow keys to toggle between instances of an app

### Browsers
These work in Chrome and Firefox (I'm not sure about )
