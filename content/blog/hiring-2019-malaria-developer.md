[We are hiring!](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/description/MED01335/senior-research-software-engineer/)  We're looking for a developer to join [our team](/about/) to work with [the malaria modelling research group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/malaria-modelling) on developing simulation models that will be used to investigate the impact of interventions to prevent the spread of malaria.

No prior experience with malaria or epidemiology is needed as you'll be working closely with a friendly team of computational researchers.  You'll work with the rest of our RSE team who will help you gather requirements from the researchers, understand the existing code, and review your code.  You'll also work with us as we plan other projects within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis).

The ideal candidate would have experience with [R](https://www.r-project.org) and C++ and interfacing the two with [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/), be into testing and enthusiastic about developing libraries and interfaces that are easy to maintain and extend.

The closing date to apply is the 1st of August, and the post is for one year in the first instance.  For more details [please see the advert](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/description/MED01335/senior-research-software-engineer/) and the [job description](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/description/MED01335/senior-research-software-engineer/JD%2BSenior%2BResearch%2BSoftware%2BEngineer%2B-%2BMalaria.doc).
