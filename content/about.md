Research Software for Infectious Disease Epidemiology - we are a team of 7 research software engineers working within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) and the [Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/infectious-disease-epidemiology) at Imperial College London.

Alex learnt to code after finishing her logic PhD back in 2013 and has worked as a full-stack web developer in a range of 
industries since then. Her favourite language these days is Kotlin but she has a soft spot for Javascript.
When not writing code she's often found gigging as a professional hula hooper (yes, that's a thing!) or messing around 
with her DJ decks.
