Research Software for Infectious Disease Epidemiology - we are a team of 7 research software engineers working within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) and the [Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/infectious-disease-epidemiology) at Imperial College London.

## The team

{{< person name="Alex Hill"img="alex.jpg" url="http://www.alexandra-hill.com/">}}
Alex learnt to code after finishing her logic PhD in 2013 and has worked as a full-stack web developer in a range of 
industries since then. Her favourite language these days is Kotlin but she has a soft spot for Javascript.
When not writing code she can often be found gigging as a professional hula hooper (yes, that's a thing!) or messing around 
with her DJ decks.

Emma started out coding laboratory process control for combinatorial chemistry, then survived several years 
in start-ups in the wild West Country before bringing her considerable web development expertise to RESIDE.
Outside of work she spends time singing with two choirs and sometimes making stained glass.

James is a mathematician who ended up in software engineering after his academic career failed to launch. Since then he's worked at a tech firm in Cambridge and as a mathematical modeller for the civil service, before moving to Imperial where he works on data visualisation for the VIMC project. He has beaten a former british go champion (at go).

{{< person name="Rich FitzJohn" img="rich.jpg" url="https://richfitz.github.io">}}
Rich was a computational biologist for 15 years before deciding that catalysing research through software was more fun than doing it himself. He's interested in making reproducibility easier and more accessible while letting scientists focus more on science than engineering. Outside of work he enjoys rock climbing and hiking.

Wes is a computer engineer and scientist, with a Ph.D making tools for ocean modelling, and then moving to modelling epidemics. He enjoys problem solving, Advent Of Code, (especially on 40-year old hardware), and making interactive and graphical teaching games. By night, he plays music and squash, and makes very good tea.
